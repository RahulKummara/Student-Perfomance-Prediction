# EduScore Predictor

## Student Perfoamnce Prediction

This project aims to predict student performance based on various factors such as gender, ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, test preparation course, and exam scores. The machine learning model trained on a dataset of student information can provide insights into predicting a student's performance in mathematics.

## Project Structure
- **notebook**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model training.
- **src**: Contains source code for model deployment and evaluation.
- **artifacts**: Stores model files and related data.
- **requirements.txt**: Dependencies needed to run the project.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/RahulKummara/Student-Perfomance-Prediction.git
3. Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. Run the application: python app.py
2. Access the web interface in your browser at 127.0.0.1:5000/predictdata
3. Fill in the student information and submit the form to obtain the predicted math score.
